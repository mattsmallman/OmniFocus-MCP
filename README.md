# OmniFocus MCP Server

> **Note**: This is a fork of [themotionmachine/OmniFocus-MCP](https://github.com/themotionmachine/OmniFocus-MCP) with additional features and enhancements. Changes are being contributed back upstream via pull requests. If you want to use these features now before they're merged, see the [installation instructions](#installing-this-fork) below.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with OmniFocus to enable Claude (or other MCP-compatible clients) to interact with your tasks and projects.

![OmniFocus MCP](assets/omnifocus-mcp-logo.png)

## Overview

This MCP server creates a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude) and your OmniFocus task management system. It gives AI models the ability to view, create, edit, and remove tasks and projects in your OmniFocus database through natural language conversations.
Some ways you could use it:

- Translate the PDF of a syllabus into a fully specificed project with tasks, tags, defer dates, and due dates.
- Turn a meeting transcript into a list of actions
- Create visualizations of your tasks, projects, and tags
- Process multiple tasks or projects in a single operation
- Bulk manage your OmniFocus items efficiently

## What's New in This Fork

This fork includes several enhancements over the upstream version:

### Architecture Improvements
- **Migrated from AppleScript to OmniJS**: Faster, more reliable automation with better error handling and maintainability
- **Enhanced tool descriptions**: More detailed guidance for AI models to use tools effectively

### New Features
- **MCP Resources**: Automatic context generation for folders, projects, tasks, and inbox with hierarchical navigation
- **Folder Management**: Create, edit, and remove folders with `add_folder`, `edit_folder`, and `remove_folder` tools
- **Task Movement**: New `move_task` and `batch_move_task` tools for reorganizing tasks efficiently
- **Batch Operations**: `batch_edit_items` for high-performance bulk editing (10-45x faster than sequential edits)
- **Review Management**: Set review intervals and mark projects as reviewed
- **Planned Date Support**: Full support for OmniFocus 4.7's new planned date feature

### Performance
- Batch operations provide significant speedups: ~230ms for batch vs 2.26s for 10 sequential operations

**Known Issues**
- Dump_database tool currently fails for very large omnifocus databases.

## Roadmap
- ~~Enable the client to interact with perspectives~~ ‚úÖ (Added list_perspectives and get_perspective_view)
- ~~Add support for the new `planned` date type in Omnifocus 4.7~~ ‚úÖ (Added plannedDate support for tasks)

- ~~Add folder management capabilities~~ ‚úÖ (Added add_folder, edit_folder, remove_folder)
- ~~Implement MCP resource features~~ ‚úÖ (Added resource generation for better context)
- Support manipulating notifications for projects and tasks
- Enhance perspective integration


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with OmniFocus installed

### Installing the Original Version

1. In Claude Desktop, add this MCP server to your configuration file at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

2. Add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "omnifocus-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

### Installing This Fork

To use the enhanced features in this fork before they're merged upstream:

1. Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

2. Add this configuration to use the fork directly from GitHub:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:mattsmallman/OmniFocus-MCP"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

**Note**: You can also specify a specific branch if needed:
```json
"args": ["-y", "github:mattsmallman/OmniFocus-MCP#add-planned-date-support"]
```

## Use Cases

### Efficient Task Queries
Use the new `query_omnifocus` tool for fast, targeted searches:
> "Show me tasks due today"
> "Get all flagged items in my Work project"  
> "Count how many tasks are in each project"

### Reorganize your projects, tasks, and tags
> "I want every task to have an energy level tag. Show me a list of all the tasks that don't have an energy level tag and your suggestions for what tag to add. I'll make any changes I think are appropriate. Then make the changes in OmniFocus."

### Add tasks from any conversation

> "Ok, thanks for the detailed explanation of why the rule of law is important. Add a recurring task to my activism project that reminds me to call my representative weekly. Include a summary of this conversation in the notes field."

### Quick, Virtual Perspectives

Get a summary of your current tasks and manage them conversationally:

> "Show me all my flagged tasks due this week"

Or create custom views:

> "What are my next actions in the Work folder?"

### Work with OmniFocus Perspectives

List and view your perspectives:

> "What perspectives do I have available?"
> "Show me what's in my Inbox perspective"
> "Get the flagged items from my current perspective"

### Reorganize Tasks

Move tasks between projects or make them subtasks:

> "Move all my inbox tasks about groceries to my Shopping project"
> "Make the task 'Research options' a subtask of 'Buy new laptop'"
> "Move the 'Review Q4 budget' task back to inbox - I need to think about it more"

### Process Transcripts or PDFs

Extract action items from meeting transcripts, academic research articles, or notes:

> "I'm pasting in the transcript from today's meeting. Please analyze it and create tasks in OmniFocus for any action items assigned to me. Put them in my 'Product Development' project."

- `includeMetadata`: (Optional) Include additional metadata like tags and dates (default: true)

## Development

Documentation to follow.

## How It Works

This server uses OmniJS (OmniFocus's JavaScript automation API) to communicate with OmniFocus, allowing it to interact with the application's native functionality. OmniJS provides direct access to OmniFocus objects and methods, making the integration fast and maintainable. The server is built using the Model Context Protocol SDK, which provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and systems.
